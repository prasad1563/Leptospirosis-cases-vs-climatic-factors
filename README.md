# ANALYZING THE LEPTOSPIROSIS INCIDENCE AND ITS ASSOCIATION WITH CLIMATIC FACTORS IN SRI LANKA

Leptospirosis is the world’s most important emerging bacterial zoonotic disease
caused by pathogenic Leptospira species. Therefore, determining the relationship
between meteorological factors (Rainfall, Temperature, Humidity) and the
leptospirosis cases in Sri Lanka may help understand meteorological factors'
impact on the emergence, spread of disease leptospirosis, and help design
effective mitigation and control strategies for leptospirosis in most threatened
areas. The objectives of this study were to conduct hot spot analysis to identify
the most threatened areas, and to build a model to understand the relationship
between meteorological factors and the reported leptospirosis cases using
Generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) approach. The data for seventeen
districts were collected from the available resources. The timespan used for this
study was from 2010 to 2018. Spearman’s correlation analysis has been done to
check the relationship between meteorological factors and leptospirosis cases in
each district, and the correlation results were not statistically significant. Then, a
Hot spot analysis has been done by using Getis-Ord (Gi*) test statistics. When
considering the overall hotspot results, from 2010 to 2017, hot spots were
gathered in most districts in Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, and NorthWestern provinces. However, in 2018, the hotspots were situated in the Northern
province. Adaptive Gaussian Quadrature (AGQ), Penalized Quasi (PQL), and
Laplace likelihood estimation methods were used to fit a GLMM model. The
validation results of the predicted values indicate that all three likelihood
estimation approaches have approximately the same symmetric mean absolute
percentage error values. However, the residual analysis depicted that the
generalized linear mixed model with adaptive gaussian quadrature likelihood
estimation method is better than other models. Therefore, GLMM with adaptive
gaussian quadrature likelihood estimation can be selected as the best model with
the highest predictive ability.
